If you are converting an existing local Great Expectations deployment to one that works in AWS, you might have Validation Results saved that you want to transfer to your S3 bucket.

To copy Validation Results into Amazon S3, use the ``aws s3 sync`` command as shown in the following example:

```bash title="Terminal input"
aws s3 sync '<base_directory>' s3://'<your_s3_bucket_name>'/'<your_s3_bucket_folder_name>'
```
The ``base_directory`` is set to ``uncommitted/validations/`` by default.

In the following example, the Validation Results ``Validation1`` and ``Validation2`` are copied to Amazon S3 and a confirmation message is returned:

```bash title="Terminal output"
upload: uncommitted/validations/val1/val1.json to s3://'<your_s3_bucket_name>'/'<your_s3_bucket_folder_name>'/val1.json
upload: uncommitted/validations/val2/val2.json to s3://'<your_s3_bucket_name>'/'<your_s3_bucket_folder_name>'/val2.json
```
