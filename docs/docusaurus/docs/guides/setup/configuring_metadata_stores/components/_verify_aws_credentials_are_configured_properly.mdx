Run the following command in the AWS CLI to verify that your AWS credentials are properly configured:

```bash title="Terminal command"
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

When your credentials are properly configured, your `UserId`, `Account` and `Arn` are returned.  If your credentials are not configured correctly, an error message appears.

If an error message appears, or if you couldn't use the AWS CLI to verify your credentials configuration, see [Configuring the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html).
