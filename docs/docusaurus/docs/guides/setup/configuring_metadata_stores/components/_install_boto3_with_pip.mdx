Python interacts with AWS through the `boto3` library.  Great Expectations makes use of this library in the background when working with AWS.  Although you won't use `boto3` directly, you'll need to install it in your virtual environment.


Run one of the following pip commands to install `boto3` in your virtual environment:

```bash title="Terminal command"
python -m pip install boto3
```

or

```bash title="Terminal command"
python3 -m pip install boto3
```

To set up [boto3](https://github.com/boto/boto3) with AWS, and use `boto3` from within Python, see the [Boto3 documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html).
