If you are converting an existing local Great Expectations deployment to one that works in AWS, you might have Expectations saved that you want to transfer to your S3 bucket.

To copy Expectations into Amazon S3, use the ``aws s3 sync`` command as shown in the following example:

```bash title="Terminal command"
aws s3 sync '<base_directory>' s3://'<your_s3_bucket_name>'/'<your_s3_bucket_folder_name>'
```
The ``base_directory`` is set to ``expectations/`` by default.

In the following example, the Expectations ``exp1`` and ``exp2`` are copied to Amazon S3 and a confirmation message is returned:

```bash title="Terminal output"
upload: ./exp1.json to s3://'<your_s3_bucket_name>'/'<your_s3_bucket_folder_name>'/exp1.json
upload: ./exp2.json to s3://'<your_s3_bucket_name>'/'<your_s3_bucket_folder_name>'/exp2.json
```
