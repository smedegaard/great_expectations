If you copied your existing Expectation Suites to the S3 bucket, run the following Python code to confirm that Great Expectations can find them:

```python
import great_expectations as gx

context = gx.get_context()
context.list_expectation_suite_names()
```

The Expectations you copied to S3 are returned as a list. Expectations that weren't copied to the new Store aren't listed.
