Setting up Great Expectations includes installing Great Expectations and initializing your deployment. Optionally, you can customize the configuration of some components, such as Stores, Data Docs, and Plugins.

After you've completed the setup for your production deployment, you can access all Great Expectations features from your <TechnicalTag relative="../" tag="data_context" text="Data Context" />. Also, your <TechnicalTag relative="../" tag="store" text="Stores" /> and <TechnicalTag relative="../" tag="data_docs" text="Data Docs" /> will be optimized for your business requirements.

To set up <TechnicalTag relative="../" tag="datasource" text="Datasources" />, <TechnicalTag relative="../" tag="expectation_suite" text="Expectation Suites" />, and <TechnicalTag relative="../" tag="checkpoint" text="Checkpoints" /> see the specific topics for these components. 

If you don't want to manage your own configurations and infrastructure, then Great Expectations Cloud might be the solution. If you're interested in participating in the Great Expectations Cloud Beta program, or you want to receive progress updates, [**sign up for the Beta program**](https://greatexpectations.io/cloud).

:::info Windows Support

Windows support for the open source Python version of GX is currently unavailable. If youâ€™re using GX in a Windows environment, you might experience errors or performance issues.

:::

## Prerequisites

- Completion of the [Quickstart guide](tutorials/quickstart/quickstart.md).
- <span>A supported version of Python. GX supports Python versions {GxData.min_python} to {GxData.max_python}.</span>
- pip (the package installer for Python).
- An internet connection.
- A web browser (for Jupyter Notebooks).
- A virtual environment. Recommended for your project workspace.

## 1. Install Great Expectations

Run the following pip command in a terminal to install Great Expectations and its dependencies:

```markup title="Terminal command:"
pip install great_expectations
```

If you experience difficulty with the installation, see <TechnicalTag relative="../" tag="supporting_resource" text="Supporting Resources" />.

## 2. Initialize a Data Context

Your Data Context contains your Great Expectations project, and it is the entry point for configuring and interacting with Great Expectations. The Data Context manages various classes and helps limit the number of objects you need to manage to get Great Expectations working.

![what the data context does for you](../images/overview_illustrations/data_context_does_for_you.png)

Run the following command to retrieve your Data Context:

```python name="tests/integration/docusaurus/setup/setup_overview.py setup"
```

To configure your Data Context, see [Data Context](./index.md#data-contexts).

## 3. Optional configurations

After you've initialized your Data Context, you can start using Great Expectations. However, a few components such as Stores, Data Docs, and Plugins that are configured by default to operate locally can be changed to hosted if it better suits your use case.

### Stores

Stores are the locations where your Data Context stores information about your <TechnicalTag relative="../" tag="expectation" text="Expectations" />, your <TechnicalTag relative="../" tag="validation_result" text="Validation Results" />, and your <TechnicalTag relative="../" tag="metric" text="Metrics" />.  By default, these are stored locally. To reconfigure a Store to work with a specific backend, see [Stores](./index.md#stores) for more information.

### Data Docs

Data Docs provide human-readable renderings of your Expectation Suites and Validation Results, and they are built locally by default. To host and share Data Docs differently, see [Data Docs](./index.md#data-docs).

### Plugins

Python files are treated as <TechnicalTag relative="../" tag="plugin" text="Plugins" /> when they are in the `plugins` directory of your project (which is created automatically when you initialize your Data Context) and they can be used to extend Great Expectations.  If you have <TechnicalTag relative="../" tag="custom_expectation" text="Custom Expectations" /> or other extensions that you want to use as Plugins with Great Expectations, add them to the `plugins` directory.
