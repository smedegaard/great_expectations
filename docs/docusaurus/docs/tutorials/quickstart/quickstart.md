# Great Expectations Quickstart

Use this quickstart to install GX, connect to sample data, build your first Expectation, validate your data, and review the validation results. This is a great place to start if you're new to GX and aren't sure if it's the right solution for you or your organization. 

:::note Great Expectations Cloud

This quickstart introduces you to the open source Python version of GX. A Cloud interface will soon be available to simplify collaboration between data teams and domain experts.

If you're interested in participating in the Great Expectations Cloud Beta program, or you want to receive progress updates, [**sign up for the Beta program**](https://greatexpectations.io/cloud).

:::info Windows Support

Windows support for the open source Python version of GX is currently unavailable. If youâ€™re using GX in a Windows environment, you might experience errors or performance issues.

## Prerequisites

- Python versions 3.8 to 3.10. See [Python downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- pip
- An internet browser

## Install GX

1. Run the following command in an empty base directory inside a Python virtual environment:

    ```bash title="Terminal input"
    pip install great_expectations
    ```

    It can take several minutes for the installation to complete. Jupyter Notebook is included with Great Expectations, and it lets you edit code and view the results of code runs.

2. Open Jupyter Notebook or Terminal and then run the following command to import the `great_expectations` module:

    ```python name="tutorials/quickstart/quickstart.py import_gx"
    ```
## Create a DataContext

- Run the following command to import the existing `DataContext` object:

    ```python name="tutorials/quickstart/quickstart.py get_context"
    ```
## Connect to Data

- Run the following command to connect to existing `.csv` data stored in the `great_expectations` GitHub repository:

    ```python name="tutorials/quickstart/quickstart.py connect_to_data"
    ```

    The example code uses the default Data Context Datasource for Pandas to access the `.csv` data in the file at the specified `path`.

## Create Expectations

- Run the following command to create two Expectations. The first Expectation uses domain knowledge (the `pickup_datetime` shouldn't be null), and the second Expectation uses [`auto=True`](../../guides/expectations/how_to_use_auto_initializing_expectations.md#using-autotrue) to detect a range of values in the `passenger_count` column. 

    ```python name="tutorials/quickstart/quickstart.py create_expectation"
    ```

## Validate data

1. Run the following command to define a Checkpoint and examine the data to determine if it matches the defined Expectations: 

    ```python name="tutorials/quickstart/quickstart.py create_checkpoint"
    ```

2. Run the following command to return the Validation results:

    ```python name="tutorials/quickstart/quickstart.py run_checkpoint"
    ```

3. Run the following command to view an HTML representation of the Validation results:

    ```python name="tutorials/quickstart/quickstart.py view_results"
    ```
